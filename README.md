A minimalist [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) component wrapping [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) or [MapLibre GL](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js) for dynamic maps.

In the spirit of keeping things light and not reinventing the wheel: this component wraps only what is necessary for dynamic updates.

Please see the [docs](https://vue-mapbox-map.web.app/) for more information!
