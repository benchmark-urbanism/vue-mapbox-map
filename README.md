A minimalist [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) component wrapping [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) for dynamic maps.

This component wraps only what is necessary for dynamic updates and returns the map object. It leaves further configuration to conventional mapbox-gl paradigms on the principle that it is unnecessary (and needlessly convoluted) to wrap every last aspect of the mapbox-gl API into a vue component.
